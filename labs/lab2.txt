List of bugs and corrections to file app.cpp


Bugs:

The function "determineGrade" is misspelled in the function definition and the function call in main(). 
Added an "e" to function name.

In the "determineGrade" function definition there is a "v" added to the line that is not supposed to be there.
Removed the "v" and moved the "grade = 'A';" over to line up with rest of the function. 

In the "determineGrade" function there is an extra ";" added to the end of the "else if (finalAvg >= 'C')".
Removed the ";". 

In the "printMsg" function there is a "v" inserted below the switch call. 
Removed the "v". 

In "printmsg" there isn't a closing "}" at the end of the function. 
Added "}".

In 'printMsg" the strcpy function is unsafe and could cause a buffer overflow. 
switched strcpy to strcpy_s. 

Added getchar() before the main() function returns 0 to allow user to read the cout messages.
